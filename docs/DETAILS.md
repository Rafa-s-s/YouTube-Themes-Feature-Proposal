# YouTube Themes Feature Proposal

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
The **Themes Tab** is an innovative feature designed for YouTube, aimed at addressing a common issue among content creators who produce videos across various genres. Currently, many creators are forced to create multiple channels to organize their videos in a way that doesn't confuse their subscribers. The **Themes Tab** offers a simple and efficient solution: video categorization within the same channel, allowing users to choose the type of content they want to consume, in a segmented manner.

### Importance of the Project
This feature is essential as it enhances the experience for both creators and users. Content creators will be able to organize all their videos in one place, while users will be able to browse only the themes that interest them, avoiding exposure to content they do not want to see. This also prevents the loss of subscribers, as segmented navigation allows the audience to consume only the relevant content.

## 2. Project Description

### How the Themes Tab Works
The **Themes Tab** adds a new section to the creator's channel, allowing them to categorize their videos into different themes. Each theme can be named by the creator based on the type of content, such as Gameplay, Comedy, Vlogs, etc. Subscribers to the channel will have the option to navigate through these themed tabs, viewing only the videos related to the theme they are interested in.

### Step-by-Step Functionality
- The creator can add and name themes directly within YouTube Studio.
- Each video can be assigned to a specific theme at the time of upload.
- Users will see tabs with different themes on the channelâ€™s homepage.
- Subscribers can choose to follow one or more themes, ensuring that videos from other genres do not interfere with their recommended video feed.
