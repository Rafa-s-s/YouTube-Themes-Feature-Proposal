# YouTube Themes Feature Proposal

## 1. Introduction

### Project Overview
The **Themes Tab** is an innovative feature designed for YouTube, aimed at addressing a common issue among content creators who produce videos across various genres. Currently, many creators are forced to create multiple channels to organize their videos in a way that doesn't confuse their subscribers. The **Themes Tab** offers a simple and efficient solution: video categorization within the same channel, allowing users to choose the type of content they want to consume, in a segmented manner.

### Importance of the Project
This feature is essential as it enhances the experience for both creators and users. Content creators will be able to organize all their videos in one place, while users will be able to browse only the themes that interest them, avoiding exposure to content they do not want to see. This also prevents the loss of subscribers, as segmented navigation allows the audience to consume only the relevant content.

## 2. Project Description

### How the Themes Tab Works
The **Themes Tab** adds a new section to the creator's channel, allowing them to categorize their videos into different themes. Each theme can be named by the creator based on the type of content, such as Gameplay, Comedy, Vlogs, etc. Subscribers to the channel will have the option to navigate through these themed tabs, viewing only the videos related to the theme they are interested in.

### Step-by-Step Functionality
- The creator can add and name themes directly within YouTube Studio.
- Each video can be assigned to a specific theme at the time of upload.
- Users will see tabs with different themes on the channel’s homepage.
- Subscribers can choose to follow one or more themes, ensuring that videos from other genres do not interfere with their recommended video feed.

These images illustrate how YouTube would appear with the new "Themes" tab. This feature adds an additional tab alongside the existing ones like "Videos," "Shorts," and "Playlists." It allows content creators to organize their videos by themes or genres, making it easier for viewers to navigate and select the type of content they want to watch in a more direct and organized manner.

After clicking on the "Themes" tab, the user is directed to the main screen of the feature. Here, the videos are divided by genres such as "Horror," "Adventure," and "Action." Each section is highlighted with a different color, which can be customized by the content creator, providing a clear and organized visual experience for viewers.

</p>

In the image above, we can see the interface of the **Themes** feature. Each theme is represented by a specific box with the genre name highlighted at the top. In this example, we have the genres *Horror*, *Adventure*, and *Action*, each containing related videos.

</p>

### Expansion Button:
- To keep the page organized and optimized, the theme boxes do not appear fully expanded. The user can click the down arrow within each box to expand and view all the videos under that theme. This helps reduce excessive page loading and ensures a smoother experience without compromising the site's performance.

</p>

### Side Navigation Arrow:
- For channels with many themes, the right arrow button allows the user to navigate between themes that are not initially visible on the screen. This provides efficient horizontal navigation through the different themes.

### Selected Theme Expansion:
- By clicking on the name of a theme (in this example, *Action*), the theme box expands to show all the videos belonging to that category. This allows the user to focus on consuming only the videos of interest without needing to browse through videos from other themes they may not want to watch at that moment.
### Close Arrow:
- In the top-right corner of the expanded theme box, there is a small arrow that allows the user to close the theme tab and return to the general view of all themes. This feature is useful when the user wants to explore other themes or return to the full channel view without the expanded tab.

</p>

### Theme View on Mobile:
- Just like in the desktop version, themes are presented in separate boxes within the Themes tab on the content creator's channel. Each theme is highlighted with the name at the top of the box, such as *Horror*, *Adventure*, and *Action*. This allows users to quickly and clearly view the different types of content on the channel, with fluid navigation optimized for mobile devices.
### Drag Navigation:
- The user can swipe sideways (drag) to navigate through the available videos within a specific theme. This makes it easier to view all videos without needing to open new pages or exit the current theme. This feature is intuitive and familiar for mobile users, ensuring smooth and practical navigation.

### Theme Management:
- The "Themes" tab within YouTube Studio lists all the themes created by the channel, such as *Horror*, *Adventure*, *Action*, *Exploration*, and others. Each theme is displayed with the number of videos it contains and the last time it was updated. This provides the creator with a quick and organized overview of the different types of content they are producing.
### Add Description:
- There is also an option to add descriptions to each theme. This can help creators briefly explain what each specific theme is about, allowing for a more personalized navigation experience for users visiting the channel.

### Theme List Icon:
- The icon that references a theme list within YouTube Studio consists of three vertical lines followed by a right-pointing triangle, symbolizing a list of videos categorized under a specific theme. This icon appears just below the number of videos in the theme list, making it easy to identify each list.

### Creating a New Theme List:
- This image shows the process of creating a new theme list in YouTube Studio. The user must click the "Create" button located in the top-right corner of the screen and then select the "New theme" option from the dropdown menu. The icon associated with creating new themes is a combination of lines and a plus symbol, representing a new thematic playlist.

- This feature would allow content creators to organize their videos more effectively, enabling viewers to subscribe to specific themes of interest.
